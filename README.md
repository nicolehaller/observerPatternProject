# observerPatternProject
CS370 spring 2023 project 
Task: choose a Design Pattern and implement it using a mock-system in Java


- My code utilized the Observer Pattern by having the Expedia Website implement an Observer Interface which notifies expedia with the number of Seats available on the flight
- In Main() I added expedia to my list of listeners which made sure it was notified when seats were bought or refunded
- I created two methods in a Plane class:
1) seatBought() if no seats available would add user to waitlist. Otherwise it would update the number of seats to be one less
2) seatRefunded() if the user doesnâ€™t want their seat anymore, their seat is refunded and  it would update the number of seats to be one more

- I created a Unit Test for each of these methods
